# GodotMationCpp
An implementation in Cpp of machinations framework in Godot Engine


The original GodotMation in GDScript along with more information can be found at: https://github.com/kakoeimon/GodotMation

The development will be parallel.

The name of the addon remains "GodotMation", GodotMation and GodotMationCpp cannot be used together, but this may change in future.

Note_1: The godotmation.gdnlib is setted only for Linux 64, so if you compile for another platform, you will have to manualy add it.
Note_2: Cause there is a bug fixed in master, but not in Godot 3.02, you will have to manually instaciate the GodotMation.tscn from the location res://addons/kakoeimon.godotmation/
